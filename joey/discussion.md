This report reiterates the importance of planning at an early stage. Although the results may vary for the final design outcome, it provides an early assessment of the possible building typologies to adopt. It will form a fundamental direction for architects when individual plots are sold to different stakeholders. Although final Model 3b did not return a 100% ‘good’ building score, it is largely successful as there is a constant improvement of the assessment of different liveability factors beginning from Model 1b.
