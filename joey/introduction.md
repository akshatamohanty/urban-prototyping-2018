# Ridge

The Ridge is located at a 75ha plot of land at Dover and is conceptualised as a continuation of urban fabric from the National University of Singapore located at Kent Ridge. The project will undergo intensification comprising of research-oriented programs and residential blocks to function as a self-sufficient mini-city. Ridge as a design concept adopts an incremental building form in the manner of intensification relevant to specific site conditions such as proximity to public transport amenities and overhead bridges.

The impetus of the project will focus on the liveability of inhabitants. Beginning from 1927, Singapore has seen a number of changes in its public housing planning policies. Today, the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) shifts its focus on creating self-sufficient towns and districts that possesses a variety of amenities catered to residents living in the area. This is evident in the development of concept plans such as Tengah and the recently constructed Kampung Admiralty. In such large-scale developments, stakeholders, developers and statutory authorities often partake in feasibility studies to assess the merit of a potential real estate investment. This is common practice as the analysis will inform stakeholders of the financial viability of the project in the long run. Creating economically-sustainable models becomes the primary concern for developers.

URA’s concept in bringing back the ‘kampung spirit’ in Kampung Admiralty reminds us that the well-being of inhabitants should remain at the core of the design process. There are many precedence in conducting meaningful feasibility studies. On the other hand, the liveability of residents play second fiddle to economic interests and are always assessed after a few years of occupation. This retrospective approach of identifying flaws and faults in design decisions is largely futile.
