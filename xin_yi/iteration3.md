# Iteration 3 - Zoning through Parametric Attractors

Various attributes are mapped in as parameter within the modelling network. 

Residential buildings (the tower blocks) are planned wtih increasing density in closer proximity to MRT stations to encourage the use of public transportation. They are also situated further from the AYE for the comfort of the residents (issues of traffic noise etc). Institution buildings (the podium blocks) are zoned close to Utown, facilitating ease of knonwledge exchange betweeen instituitions and offices and R&D from the convenience of proximity. They are also planned in increasing density along the AYE (since those buildings are more likely to be air-conditioned and closed off, where noise will be less of a concern), allowing a buffer distance between residential blocks and AYE. Commercial buildings (the precinct blocks) are present in every urban block, providing a sense of enclosure for the public space that resides within it. 


__Generative Process__

This is generated through the following process:

Dividing site into urban blocks > Forming plots > __Specifying relative density for each required program__ > Make building > Evaluate building


__Changes from iteration #02__

* changes to required relative density for institution buildings
* changes to required relative density for residential buildings
