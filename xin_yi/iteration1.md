# Iteration 1 - Morphology of Urban Block

Figure 1.0 Iteration 1

For the first iteration, the different “tiers” of the urban block are generated in order to form the podium + tower typology.

### Generative Process

This is generated through the following process:

Dividing site into urban blocks > Forming plots > Specifying relative density for each required program > Make building > Evaluate building

### Parameters

* Residential storey height: 3m
* Commercial storey height: 5m
* Institutional storey height: 4m
* Road width: 8m

### Changes to Iteration 

* increasing the street width (thereby improving the view factor and daylight factor)
     * changed polyexpand setting: offset (inside) from 4m to 6m
* rotating building angle to better align with east-west orientation, for better daylight
     * done by editing scale of primitive of both the podium plots: x:0.6, y:0.4, z:1
