# Urban Ventilation

**CHONG Xin Yi**

*Abstract:* 

This project aims to generate urban neighbourhood with a good ventilation by incorporating urban wind environment design. Through iterative computational modelling, sequential urban prototypes are generated in reaching that aim. The changes made during iterations include variation of building orientation and street width, changes to building morphology, and the use of various parameters to inform the relative density of the institution and residential buildings. Wind-driven design aspects include adequate street canyon for 
urban ventilation, dispersal of air pollutants, and dissipation of anthropogenic heat; alignment of main streets to prevailing wind direction to maximise penetration of prevailing winds; and the incorporation of a designated air path within the site.
