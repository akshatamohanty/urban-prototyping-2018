# Clusters

**PAU Jing Si**

Abstract: My project aims to use the surrounding context to dissect the proposed site into several potential clusters. Three main iterations were carried out, in which, two of them having sub-iterations in attempts to improve evaluation results. The first iteration explores the potential of having three distinct clusters: work-live-play, residential and industrial. The second iteration was mainly focused on providing a research-cum-dormitory cluster for the surrounding tertiary institutions. For the first two iterations, a courtyard typology was employed and the evaluation results were not very desirable. However, after using the cross layout in Iteration 3, evaluation results improved. This suggests that the cross-layout typology might be a better alternative to the courtyard typology.
