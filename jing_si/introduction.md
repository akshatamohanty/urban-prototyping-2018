The proposed site is sandwiched in between Dover Road on the northside and one major highway on the southside, the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). Mainly tertiary education institutes surround the site. Such as Anglo Chinese Junior College, Singapore Polytechnic and National University of Singapore. The surrounding site context will inform zoning strategies in   subsequent iterations to come.
