*(Three Distinct Clusters)* 
  
The first iteration explores the zoning of three distinct clusters derived from the existing roads, with two parks inserted in between them. Cluster #01 aims to house a mixture of residential, commercial shops and offices, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem. This arrangement is inspired by the work-live-play lifestyle that many are adopting. Similar to Cluster #01, Cluster #02 utilises the podium-tower typology. It consist of mainly mixed-use residential blocks, with commercial shops at the podium and residential tower above. Cluster #03 acts as a buffer zone between the residential areas of the previous two clusters and Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE). Thus, it is lined with industrial buildings and offices along AYE.
