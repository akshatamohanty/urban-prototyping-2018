The second iteration is an improved version of the first one, which takes into account that the site is surrounded by tertiary educational institutions. Besides zoning the clusters based on the current road conditions, each cluster is carefully considered based on its surrounding context. Being surrounded by both NUS University Town and Singapore Polytechnic, Cluster #01 serves as a research cluster for both institutions to collaborate and house dormitories scattered within the cluster. Cluster #02 aims to provide for the work-live community, with residential blocks situated adjacent to offices. Working in tandem to Cluster #02, Cluster #03 is a creative research and development hub that is within close proximity to the MRT. Similar to the previous iteration, Cluster #04 acts as a buffer zone for the rest of the site, due to the Ayer Rajah Expressway. Instead of housing industrial buildings, I have opted for gated communities instead, for their sparse building distribution.
