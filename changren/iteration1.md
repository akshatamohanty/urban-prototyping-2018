# Iteration 1

## Premise
  Assume that the bottom of buildings are all rectangulars. Take the extreme case,assume that windows along the long side are all good windows, the height of each floor is 3m, the maximum area of good windows will be 2XZ, and total area of one building will be (XYZ/ 3). If the good window ratio is larger than 0.3, the maximum length of Y will be (2XZ/(XYZ/3) > 0.3),that is ***20 Meters***. Therefore, my buildings in all the iterations will be having shortest sides shorter than 20 meters.
