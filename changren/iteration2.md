# Iteration 2

## Concept
In this iteration, I decide to adopt a new urban morphology, that is distributing service functions such as commercial, office, catering and entertainment under every apartment blocks.At the same time, the east-west facing buildings will be substituted by greenery which can ensure that each residential building has green spaces adjacent to it.

This scheme is inspired by Unité d'Habitation, each block is like a small city. Ludwig Hilberseimer’s well-known Vertical City is also took as a reference.
