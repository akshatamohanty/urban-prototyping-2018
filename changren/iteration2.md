# Iteration 2

## Concept
In this iteration, I will take these requirements as key points, and the final goals are as follows:
1.Every apartment block can have its own greenery
2.Service functions are juxtaposed with residential buildings.
3.Create street hierarchy

So I decided to arrange Residential and commercial buildings in an ABAB form, which solves the problem of lacking sunshine in the previously proposed residential buildings.

## Genration Process
The green space together with the neighborhood segment the lane boundary effectively, and supermarkets are arranged in the center of most green areas. The depth of residences is 16m, of commercial buildings is 20m, distance between two buildings is 73m. There is a corridor connection between residence and commercial.

## Improvement
Some residential buildings have not reached the standard, mainly because the height is too high, resulting in insufficient spacing. This is easy to solve and does not need to change the building pattern. For the unsatisfactory commercial part, another arrangement needs to be considered, provided that each residential building still needs a commercial building around.
