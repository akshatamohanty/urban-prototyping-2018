# Iteration 2

## Concept

Residential and commercial buildings are arranged in an ABAB form, which solves the problem of lacking sunshine in the previously proposed commercial buildings.

## Improvement
Some residential buildings have not reached the standard, mainly because the height is too high, resulting in insufficient spacing. This is easy to solve and does not need to change the building pattern. For the unsatisfactory commercial part, another arrangement needs to be considered, provided that each residential building still needs a commercial building around.
