# Iteration 2

## Concept
In this iteration, I decide to adopt a new urban morphology, that is distributing service functions such as commercial, office, catering and entertainment under every apartment blocks.At the same time, the east-west facing buildings will be substituted by greenery which can ensure that each residential building has green spaces adjacent to it.

This scheme is inspired by Unité d'Habitation, each block is like a small city. Ludwig Hilberseimer’s well-known Vertical City is also took as a reference.

## Generation process
First, rectangular building bases are used to generate commercial buildings (including all service functions such as retail and entertainment).I calculated the distance between each building and AYE, and allocated commercial area based on this. The closer to AYE, the larger area will be. The highest one has 20 floors.

Second step is to move the building bottom which later will be used to generate residences upward, each one moves at a specific distance determined by the height of its corresponding commercial building. The area allocation will be affected by the three MRT stations. The closer to the MRT station, the more residents should be. The highest apartment block has 40 floors.
