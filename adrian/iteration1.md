# Iteration 1

In iteration 1, programs are arranged responding to its adjacent programs and transport amenities.


**Industrial** 

Industrial buildings (Grey) acts as a physical buffer between the Ayer Rajah Expressway (AYE) and the rest of the programs on site. Forming a concrete screen to alleviate issues such as noise pollution. Layout of the industrial block follows a single story volume, with an internal courtyard green space. This is to facilitate loading / unloading of heavy equipment as the provision of green spaces for workers.

**Green Spine**

Green spine segregates the industrial and residential functions. Providing a recreational zone for residents and workers of the district.

**Residential / Retail**

Residential programs (Yellow) are located primarily along Dover road and north Buona Vista road, for greater accessibility to Dover, one-north MRT Stations. Residential typology comes in the form of podium blocks as well as high rise towers (figure 1c). 
For podium blocks (figure 1d), retail programs (Red) occupy the first 2 floors, with residential on the top 7 floors. The mix of high rise and low rise residential accommodations within the site, in turn influences the intimacy of community spaces created (private green, community parks). 

**Office**

Office developments are positioned between residential and retail programs. The three programs form a mutually beneficial relationship due to their close proximity. The estimated workforce of 30000 workers can reside with the neighbouring residential units, with close access to necessities from retail outlets as well.

**Passive Ratio / Good Window Analysis**

Industrial, offices, podium typologies demonstrates good results for both passive ratio and good window. However high rise residential tower exhibit shortfalls in these both aspects. In particular high rise residential towers displayed an average good window ratio of 0.04 and passive ratio of 0.32. This result is exceptionally bad and far off from the desired good building thresholds (good window threshold > 0.1, passive ratio > 0.5). This result is likely attributed to the large floor area of the towers, forming a larger active area as compared to passive area. In subsequent iterations, plot sizes were reduced and proximity between towers were adjusted to produce better buildings
