# Introduction

The proposed site located adjacent to National University of Singapore and one-north is projected to be an industrial and collaboration hub in the district, tapping upon the wealth of resources and information from the university and one-north. However the existing site does present certain issues of disconnectivity to its neighbours, segregated by the Ayer Rajah Expressway and several main roads. Initial response to the site conditions was to develop a way to allocate programs that responds favourably to its neighbours, in terms of reaching the desired population quantity and optimal building form.

An urban prototyping study was conducted to devise an urban proposal for the 75ha proposed site with an estimated population of 75000 people. The projected industrial and collaborative district will house an intensified mix of research clusters, production facilities, housing accommodations and cross disciplinary platforms. Thereby engendering a healthy mix of established industries as well as entrepreneurship startups, a testbed for the development and creation of new technologies and innovation.

The goal of the study is to achieve an optimal mix of programmatic spaces, green spaces and collaborative platforms for sharing of information and resources across all expertise on site. Additionally building forms also evolve based on climatic factors, active to passive ratios and view potentials, thereby achieving desirably living conditions and sustainable building typologies.
