# Introduction

An urban prototyping study was conducted to devise an urban proposal for the 75ha proposed site with an estimated population of 75000 people. The projected industrial and collaborative district will house an intensified mix of research clusters, production facilities, housing accommodations and cross disciplinary platforms. Thereby engendering a healthy mix of established industries as well as entrepreneurship startups, a testbed for the development and creation of new technologies and innovation.

The goal of the study is to achieve an optimal mix of programmatic spaces, green spaces and collaborative platforms for sharing of information and resources across all expertise on site. Additionally building forms also evolve based on climatic factors, active to passive ratios and view potentials, thereby achieving desirably living conditions and sustainable building typologies.
