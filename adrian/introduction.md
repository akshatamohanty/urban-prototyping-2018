# Introduction

Urban prototyping on Houdini was conducted to devise an urban proposal for the 75ha site at one-north with an estimated population of 75000 people. The projected industrial and collaborative district will house a mix of workers living on site, workers living off site and other users who visit the site. The objective of the urban strategy is to foster an intensified mix of work-live and recreational spaces on site while also engendering a collaborative platform for sharing of ideas and resources.
