# Iteration 3


•	![Fig. 1: Plot Overview](imgs/fig 3a_plot division.JPG) 



For Iteration 3, I wanted to introduce ways in which the site can connect to adjacent estates as well as within internal clusters. Here the plot is divided into 4 key clusters.
Work-Live Zone is located nearest to the respective MRT Stations, facilitating residents who take the public transport.
R&D Zone required larger volume buildings, and is located adjacent to the AYE, forming a buffer for the rest of the site. Plot of land required for industrial is reduced from previous iterations, allocating more spaces for the other zones. 
The Collaboration Zone, in the middle, contains a program mix of residential, retail and offices. This zone is designed as a collaborative platform, connecting the adjacent clusters on site as well as direct linkage from NUS itself. Thereby establishing a common ground for research, business and industrial collaboration.

With these plot zones in mind, I then proceeded to introduce typologies within each respective cluster, fulfilling the hybrid program mix.
