# Iteration 3: Greens for Everyone and More

The typology of the third iteration is in lieu with iteration 1 and 2, emulating one of a highly dense built-up environment. The height of the residential blocks are affected by the proximity to the MRT nodes, although certain anomalies have started to appear. This is probably due to the stress placed on the fulfilment of the allocated 75m^2 per person on the site while still having to satisfy the notion of preplanned greens and designation of central park in this iteration. The elevation shows the skyline of the urban planning. The distribution is becoming one of large discrepancy between the residency and others programmes like commerical and offices. There was a sudden increase in building height, where 1 building is an anomaly in its extreme height, as well as a number of pretty tall skyscrapers.

The greens are allocated in 2 ways: one of the subplot in the urban plot that manifest itself as a 1000m^2 localized green space to be shared by each plot's users and the other in the form of a central park.

A total of 75m^2 is allocated to each person on site. The following is the breakdown of the allocation of plot percentage. Residential was allocated the highest percentage for improved standard of living.

Commercial: 10m^2
Office: 15m^2 
Residential: 50m^2

<p align="center"> 4 analysis of good buildings

In addition to the "good" residential buildings, there is a visible amount of offices that are "good" as well. This is in reaction to the localized greens on each plot that allows for greater passive ratio. That being said, the solar factor has also visibly increased due to the exposure to solar element in "empty" green plots. It has always been a balance in terms of allowing for dayighting and passivity in contrast to the solar radiation that each building will be exposed to. Overall, the percentage of "good" buildings has increased to 50.4% in comparison to iteration 1.

Unexpectedly, as what we observe from iteration 1, the high percentage of "good" windows has still maintained although statistically, it has decreased by 1%. The percentage of "good" views and good window ratio is still positive overall.

Percentage of Good Windows: 83.2%
