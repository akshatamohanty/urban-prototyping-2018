# 3.Iteration 1: Voronoi Fractured Grid

This iteration features simulation based on one block typology tested on Type 1 Voronoi fracture grid as described in the introduction of the chapter. Iteration 1 features the first block typology where the residential tower sits on the commercial podium block. The roof of the commercial and residential are sky gardens, and there is a central courtyard in the residential tower for increased ventilation and inner courtyard views.

## 2.3.	Plot Distribution

Various organisational methods and road widths were considered when dividing the plot. We came out with 3 types of grid distribution and gave them an evaluation in terms of its density, road organisation, avaliability of green spaces and its implications on view and facings. This is to understand the benefits of each apportionment method and bring its lessons forward to a scheme that is “bent and heterogeneous”.

## 2.4.	Standards for simulations

Subsequent simulations will be based on the following standards

For good windows, 
* view_threshold>0.4 
* daylight_threshold>0.1 
* solar_threshold<0.2 

For good building thresholds, 
* passive_threshold>0.5 
* good_window_threshold>0.1
