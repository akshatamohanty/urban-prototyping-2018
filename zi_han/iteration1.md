# 3.Iteration 1: Voronoi Fractured Grid

This iteration features simulation based on one block typology tested on Type 1 Voronoi fracture grid as described in the introduction of the chapter. Iteration 1 features the first block typology where the residential tower sits on the commercial podium block. The roof of the commercial and residential are sky gardens, and there is a central courtyard in the residential tower for increased ventilation and inner courtyard views.

### 3.2.1.	Good Building = 91.64%
* Daylight factor = 65.74%
* Passive ratio = 96.15%
* Solar Factor = 83.19% 

### 3.2.2.	Good Window =36.86%
* View Factor = 60.97%
* Good window ratio = 92.56%

## 3.3.	Evaluation

While this iteration proved a high number of good buildings, this iteration has a high number of bad windows. This is due to the way the grid had been laid out, with irregular 4 to 6-sided polygon blocks with windows facing closely to adjacent blocks. This in turn also affects the view factor, giving it xxx.
From an Urban morphology point of view, the irregular 4 to 6-sided polygon blocks are less desirable for land developers to purchase and build. Also, it leads to impractical road situations with junctions of 3 and 5 roads.
In the next iteration, the plot will be divided more regularly with the Manhattan grid so as to improve view factors and hence more good window.
