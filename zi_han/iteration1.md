# 3.Iteration 1: Voronoi Fractured Grid

This iteration features simulation based on one block typology tested on Type 1 Voronoi fracture grid as described in the introduction of the chapter. Iteration 1 features the first block typology where the residential tower sits on the commercial podium block. The roof of the commercial and residential are sky gardens, and there is a central courtyard in the residential tower for increased ventilation and inner courtyard views.
