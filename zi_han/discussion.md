Apportionment of plot and the setting out of road networks was essential in determining the result of an efficient and sustainable urbanscape. We need to determine road networks and the way the plot is subdivided so that the plot relates to its surrounding context.
Through rounds of building simulations using quantifiable factors, parameters and specifications, we were able to determine the efficiency of each urban design option and find an optimal way of designing the plot. This urban morphology is dependent on population density apportioned by attractor and repeller nodes in the site context.

As observed, the best plot distribution option is Iteration 3, where the road network integrates to its existing adjacent roads networks. It is to be noted that the distance between building blocks plays a tremendous role in determining the building’s passive ratio, daylight factor and solar factor and hence building efficiency. Option 3B achieves the best results with 83.68% Good building and 25.35% Good windows (without considering courtyard greenery and landscape as “desirable” views). In terms of building typology, the courtyard tower option, 3A and 3B is observed to have opportunities to attain high view-factor if we consider greenery and landscaping in the courtyard as a “desirable” view. Option 3C has missed opportunities without a courtyard, but it is an economical and popular choice for developers.
