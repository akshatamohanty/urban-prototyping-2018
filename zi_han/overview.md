**LIM Zi Han**

Abstract: This project seeks to continue Zaha Hadidâ€™s concept for one-north masterplan, which aims to permit a heterogeneous urban grid with a green connector across the plot as a space for respite and connectivity.

one-north industrial park was developed by JTC Corporation for the R&D and high technology cluster, comprising biomedical sciences, info-communication technology and media industries. Just situated in adjacency to National University of Singapore, Singapore Polytechnique and Science park.

Currently, in its adjacent plots, there is an estimated target population of 65,000 people working on the site. However, the current residential provision on one-north is only for a total population of 3015 people, in the form of service apartments, condominiums and landed housing and only 260 rooms in hotels nearby. The project explores the planning of residential and commercial mixed-used buildings to avoid the housing shortage experienced by neighbouring plots and accommodate 75,000 people whom can work and live in the same neighbourhood.
