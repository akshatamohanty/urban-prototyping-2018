# Magic Magic Pow Wow

**Abraham David Noah**

This project is an explorative journey into how different urban fabrics can be quickly generated, visualized and analyzed using a procedural method in Houdini. 

The following three chapters traces the evolution of three distinct urban planning approaches. 

**The first uses a top-down method to create a gridded city with a digital twist.**

**The second uses modular blocks to create a dynamic skyline with fixed rules.**

**The third is a bold inversion of street and blocks.**
  
Each of these cities underwent extensive steps to achieve the current form and performance. Every step in the procedural process was met with a feedback and the feedback was looped back into the step to perfect the algorithm. 

The aim of each iteration is to create two end products, one tangible and one intangible. The tangible product is the high performance and livable urban form, and the intangible is the procedural algorithm which adjusts and adapts to site conditions, generating new forms whenever site conditions change. 

It wishes to prove that a procedurally generated urban plan is both effective and adaptive. Wisely used, it shall become a powerful advisor to planners to make more informed design decisions in real situations.
