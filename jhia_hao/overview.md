# Converse-City: Central Nervous System as Spine for Interactions

**GAM Jhia Hao**

_Abstract_

The city is a place of encounters and interactions. Tay Kheng Soonâ€™s concept of a Central Nervous System as a nexus of interactions and innovation was used as a strategy in connecting NUS Utown to One-North Fusionopolis, creating a seamless pedestrian corridor for collaborations. Using plot size and building typologies, 3 main iterations are generated to understand the implications of the pedestrian corridor on the urban form for interactions. Performative indicators like daylight and solar factor, views and active-passive areas are used to gauge the effectiveness of the windows and the buildings themselves. The results shows a mixture of courtyard and u-shaped blocks respective to the curvature of the pedestrian corridor is most suitable for a conducive environment for interactions. In addition, plot sizes and the segmentation of the site are also important elements in mixing and organizing the programs of residential, office, industrial and commercial together.
