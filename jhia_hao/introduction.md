# Introduction

The city is a place of encounters and interactions. This in turn spur collaboration and innovation. 

Flanked by Dover road and the Ayer-Rajah Expressway (AYE), the site is sandwiched between 2 main innovation clusters, namely the National University of Singapore (NUS) UTown clusters and the One-North’s Fusionopolis clusters. By linking the 2 clusters together, it may create better synergy between the education and research & development arm of innovation. Therefore, it can foster better communications and in turn, opportunities for collaborations to take place. Hence, the urban form should provide a platform for this physical connection from NUS Utown to Fusionopolis. 

Tay Kheng Soon’s concept of a Central Nervous System (CNS) in the urban fabric provides an insight to how to connect the clusters and encourage interactions. Central to the idea of CNS, it is a physical pedestrianized boulevard that runs through an entire site for ease of walking. On both sides of the boulevard are commercial areas that would draw people to the CNS for interactions and engagement in public activities. The CNS is a corridor of a series of greenspaces, event plazas, pathways that spills into smaller routes, alleyways that brings you further into the site. With the CNS, it not only connect two destinations together, it is also an avenue for meeting, congregation and interactions for innovative collaborations.
