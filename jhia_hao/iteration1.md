_2.1 Iteration 1A: Small Plots_

In this mini-iteration, both Dover and AYE precinct are split into 40 segments, generating a mixture of slab and point blocks for the residential, industrial, office and commercial function. They range from low-rise 3-storey blocks to 10-storey blocks with commercial being the lowest (yellow) and residential the highest (red). These blocks are lined along the meandering pedestrianized corridor. Overall, it is a carpet of low-rise to mid-rise blocks that follows the sensual curves of the pedestrianized corridor.

Overall, it has a majority of bad buildings. This is largely due to view obstructions caused by the close proximity of the blocks, resulting in a high concentration of bad windows amongst the blocks. However, the closely packed slab blocks are good for shielding direct sunlight, thus registered acceptable range of solar factor.
