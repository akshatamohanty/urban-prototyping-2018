# Iteration 2

For iteration 2, other than decreasing the thickness of the buildings, I also separated the buildings into 4 different typologies - industrial, offices, residential and commercial.

>Grid> Polyexpand> 'Make-Octogon'> Boolean Intersect (with courtyards)> Boolean Intersect (with site)> Boolean Subtract (with road going through entire site)

**Final results**

Total number of buildings evaluated: 123

Daylight Factor Ratio: 79.70%

Solar Factor Ratio: 74.95%

Conclusion

The Passive Area Ratio has improved a lot from iteration 1a and 1b, and so have the "good" building and "good" window ratios.
However, the buildings can still be further improved. As a large number of buildings with low passive area are
