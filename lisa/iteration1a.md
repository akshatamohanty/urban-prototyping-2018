# Iteration 1a

An octogonal grid is first constructed. Then courtyards are punched into the individual building blocks, and plot areas less than 1000m2 are converted into parks.

Good Building Evaluation


The results were astonishing as almost all the buildings were bad buildings. 

After going through the evaluation nodes I realised the reasons why.
1. The buliding blocks were too close together, resulting in bad views and subsequently bad windows. 
2. The individual buildings were too wide, resulting in a bad passive factor and subsequently bad buildings.
