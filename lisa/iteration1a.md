# Iteration 1a

An octogonal grid is first constructed. Then courtyards are punched into the individual building blocks, and plot areas less than 1000m2 are converted into parks. 

>Grid> Polyexpand> 'Make-Octogon'> Boolean Intersect (with courtyards)> Boolean Intersect (with site)

Good Building Evaluation


The results were astonishing as almost all the buildings were bad buildings. 

After going through the evaluation nodes I realised the reasons why.
1. The buliding blocks were too close together, resulting in bad views and subsequently bad windows. 
2. The individual buildings were too wide, resulting in a bad passive factor and subsequently bad buildings.
