This project was inspired by the urban planning done in Barcelona - my personal experience of exploring the streets of Barcelona was very enjoyable. It was lively and exciting at every turn, yet well structured and easy to navigate around.

The essence of Barcelona is its hexagon-shaped building blocks.
