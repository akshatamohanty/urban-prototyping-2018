# Iteration 3

Iteration 3 builds on the block typology and road network that provided the best balance between simulation results and design concept in Iteration 2, Iteration 02/C.

## 02 / A

With how view factors were affected by the close proximity between commercial and residential blocks, partial sections were removed from the commercial blocks closest to the residential towers (i.e. by creating a "polyexpand2d" residential tower plot and "boolean subtract" residential tower from commercial block). To increase passive area ratios, residential tower blocks were split into four towers instead. The split would result in smaller plot areas, thus resulting in an increase in floor count improving view factor and daylight factor.
