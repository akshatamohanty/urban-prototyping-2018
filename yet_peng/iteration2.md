# Iteration 2

Iterations 02/A-C, similar to Iteration 1, features simulations based on one block typology situated in the three road networks described in the introduction of this chapter.

## 02 / A

Iteration 02/A features the second block typology where the shops and offices occupy three-quarters of the area, much larger than the first typology to reduce obstructions for the residential towers, with added courtyards to improve passive area ratio for the larger commercial blocks. Density does not change in this iteration - i.e. commercial blocks cluster towards the AYE while residential blocks towards the MRT nodes.
