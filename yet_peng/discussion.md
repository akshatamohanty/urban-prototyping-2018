Situating different typologies into three different road networks was an interesting exercise to test out a variety to parameters and specifications and their effectiveness in terms of quantifiable factors. Although the end target was geared towards a road network that could satisfy both the urban community concept of a woonerf street and daylight qualities of the built form (i.e. 01/C, 02/C), iterations A and B were able to illustrate which areas to adjust to achieve certain results.

With an end result of 85.7% good buildings and 91.1% good windows, iteration 3 improved tremendously from 01/C which had 55.7% good buildings and 79.2% good windows. Areas of improvement, however, include maximum floor count, view factor and daylight factor which deteriorated from 01/C.
