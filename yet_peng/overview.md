# Megapolis and the Garden City

**CHIA Yet Peng**

Situated at the heart of a growing, cutting edge technological research and commercial site abutting the National University of Singapore, the design aims to encapsulate the concept of a megapolis in a Garden City. Bringing in the Dutch concept of a woonerf street, the subsequent chapters will simulate certain block typologies in 3 main road networks. The final simulation will involve the iteration that best manifests the design concept as well as quantifiable simulation results.
