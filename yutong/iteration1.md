# Iteration 1

## Basic Parameter 

Residential storey height: 3m

Commercial storey height: 5m

Office storey height: 4m

Industry storey height: 10m

Shops storey height: 5m

Street: 9m

Lanes: 6m

Maximum floor count: 33

Average floor count: 4

Total number of buildings: 571

## Simulation

Good Window =47.9% 

Daylight factor = 67%

Solar Factor = 86.9% 

View Factor = 66.2%

Good Building = 43.6%

Passive ratio = 67.1%

Good window ratio = 62.9%

## Evaluation

Zone1:

Since the plots are quite large and the number of floors is less, the expected change trend is not achieved. Due to the problem that the average building height is too low, solar and daylight factor are further affected, while the floor is too average, which affects view. Overall assessment is poor. By adjusting the offset in polyexpand node and increasing the number of plot, the number of building floors was increased, which significantly increased the blue buildings. 

Zone2:

Due to the dense tower block, the east and west facades are not illuminated and the view is poor, resulting in a high ratio of bad Windows. Relatively speaking, the situation of the largest building group which is located in eastern area is worse, also the land utilization is low. In this group, the building is deep in north to sorth, which makes the area of bad (east and west) facade too large. What’s more, due to the influence of the gap between north and south, the view factor of the ground floor is poor.
In conclusion, both form of the buildings in two zones need to be reformed, and there’s also has room to adjust the road grid, in order to gain a better result.
