# Iteration 2
## Basic Parameter
Street: 20m

Lanes:10m

Maximum floor count: 57

Average floor count: 7

Total number of buildings: 508

## Simulation 
Good Window =58.1% 

Daylight factor = 75.1%

Solar Factor = 84.9% 

View Factor = 83.8%

Good Building = 82.9%

Passive ratio = 100%

Good window ratio = 82.9%

## Road Network

On the basis of Iteration1, in zone1, the width of the road network is increased, and the plot area is relatively reduced to 90m*60m. After the adjustment, evaluation parameters will be improved to a certain extent. The change of zone2 is to extend the middle road and divide the largest plots in the east, the internal courtyards from the previous five to six. After the change, the land utilization will be greatly improved, the only possible drawback is that the lighting of two rows of buildings along the middle road may be affected to some extent.
